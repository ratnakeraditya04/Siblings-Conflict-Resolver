# Siblings-Conflict-Resolver
This is a simple website which actually implements a simple idea of solving conflicts among the siblings. 
Though, it can be very useful in solving many problems in day to day life where we have to choose between the two options that are getting very difficult to choose between them. 

Guidelines of Using it -
1. Open the WEBSITE.
2. Assign the problem to each of the dice. 
3. Refresh the page to roll the dice. 

Whichever dice gets the highest number should(may) be your choice to go with. If by any means numbers on both dice are equal then for choosing between them refresh the page to get the clear winner.
